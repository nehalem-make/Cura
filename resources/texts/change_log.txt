Please, be aware that after version 4.10 Ultimaker Cura will only be supported on operating systems actively maintained by their software manufacturer or community. This means Windows 7 and MacOS 10.13 will no longer be supported. Technically this means Ultimaker will stop testing and developing for such operating systems. However, even though it is no longer supported, there is still a high likelihood the application keeps functioning.

[4.9.1]
* PETG Profile update.
Ultimaker PETG profiles have been added. The Generic PETG profile for 2.85mm filaments has been updated as well.

* Bug Fixes
- The second extruder should now prime properly again when using a prime blob.
- Reduced the flood of QML errors in the log file. Contributed by fieldOfView.
- Fixed a crash when entering layer view on MacOS 10.13.6. Contributed by jwrw.

[4.9.0]
<i>For an overview of the new features in Cura 4.9, please watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=q7IJ0I9Mi1I&feature=youtu.be">our video</a>.</i>

* Digital factory integration.
Now you can open files directly from Digital Library projects. Then, after preparation, quickly and easily export them back. This feature is available for all users with an Ultimaker Essentials, Professional, or Excellence subscription. <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/enterprise-software"> Learn more</a>

* "Line type" is now the default color scheme.
When entering the Preview mode, you don't have to switch manually to line type. 

* Z-seam is now clearly shown in preview mode.
This ensures that you will know whether the seam will be sufficiently hidden in the end product. This will also indicate the starting point of the print.
<i> Thanks to BasF0 for contributing to this feature </i>

* New 'line width' color-scheme available in preview mode.
Line-width can now be selected as a color-scheme in preview mode.

* Weight estimation in decimals.
This provides a more detailed idea of the amount of material used - which is especially useful for smaller prints. 

* Split Shell category into Walls and Top/Bottom. 
The shell category was a mix of settings about walls and settings about top/bottom, splitting them into two categories makes more sense. 

* Post-processing script to embed screenshot in g-code.
The ability to have thumbnails embedded. Contributed by Gravedigger7789.

* Add checkbox for Extruder Offsets.
Ability to enable or disable the extruder offsets to gcode. This will be enabled by default, unless it is in the printer's def.json file. Contributed by RFBomb. 

* Cura should work properly on MacOS 'Big Sur' now, afforded by upgrades to Python (to 3.8) and Qt (to 5.15).
If you had (UX, visual, graphics card) problems, specifically on (newer) MacOS versions, like Big Sur, you should be able to use this new version.

[4.8.0]
<i>For an overview of the new features in Cura 4.8, please see this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI1n4IDHbuA">Change log overview</a>.</i>

* New arrange algorithm!
Shout-out to Prusa Research, since they made the libnest2d library for this, and allowed a licence change.

* When opening a project file, pick any matching printer in addition to just exact match and new definition.
Previously, when someone sent you a project, you either had to have the exact same printer under the exact same name, or create an entirely new instance. Now, in the open project dialog, you can specify any printer that has a(n exactly) matching printer-type.

* Show warning message on profiles that where successfully imported, but not supported by the currently active configuration.
People where a bit confused when adding profiles, which then didn't show up. With this new version, when you add a profile that isn't supported by the current instance (but otherwise correctly imported), you get a warning-message.

* Show parts of the model below the build-plate in a different color.
When viewing the build-plate from below, there's now shadow visible anymore. As this helped the user determine what part of the model was below the buildplate, we decided to color that part differently instead.

* Show the familiar striped pattern for objects outside of the build-volume in Preview mode as well.
Models outside of the build-volume can of course not be sliced. In the Prepare mode, this was already visible with solid objects indicated in the familiar grey-yellow striped pattern. Now you can also see the objects that are still in the scene just outside if the build-volume in Preview mode.

* Iron the top-most bottom layer when spiralizing a solid model, contributed by smartavionics
Ironing was only used for top-layers, or every layer. But what is the biggest flat surface in a vase? This helpful pull request made it so that, in this case, the top-most bottom layer is used to iron on.

* Allow scrolling through setting-tooltips, useful for some plugins.
Certain plugins, such as the very useful Settings Guide, occasionally have very large tooltips. This update allows you to scroll through those.

* Bug Fixes
- <u>Fixed under-simplification (blobs, zits) on some printer models.</u> <i>An oversight in 4.6.x resulted in an oversimplification (smoothing) of models. The attempted fix in 4.7.x overcompensated, which gave difficulty (zits, blobs) for some printer models when the resulting gcode became too intricate. This is now fixed, though some profiles might need to be updated, since they where made against 4.6.x, and therefore may rely on the over-simplification.</i>
- Fix percentage text-fields when scaling non-uniformly.
- Fix cloud printer stuck in connect/disconnect loop.
- Fix rare crash when processing stair stepping in support.
- Fix sudden increase in tree support branch diameter.
- Fix cases of tree-support resting against vertical wall.
- Fix conical support missing on printers with 'origin at center' set.
- Fix infill multiplier and connected lines settings not cooperating with each other.
- Fixed an issue with skin-edge support, contributed by smartavionics
- Fix printer renaming didn't always stick after restart.
- Fix move after retraction not changing speed if it's a factor 60 greater.
- Fix Windows file alteration detection (reload file popup message appears again).
- OBJ-file reader now doesn't get confused by legal negative indices.
- Fix off-by-one error that could cause horizontal faces to shift one layer upwards.
- Fix out of bounds array and lost checks for segments ended with mesh vertices, contributed bt skarasov
- Remove redundant 'successful responses' variable, contributed by aerotog
- In rare cases, brim and prime-tower-bim would overlap.
- Fix support for some models when bottom distance and stair step height where both 0 (like with PVA).
- An issue with infill only overlap modifier when the wall line count was overridden in the global settings.
- Filling gaps between walls would also fill between skin and infill.

[4.7.1]
<i>For an overview of the new features in Cura 4.7, please see this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuKuil0dJqE">Change log overview</a>.</i>

* Bug fixes
- Fixed a crash when duplicating a built-in profile.
- Having an equals symbol in your start or end g-code would cause part of that g-code to disappear and could cause a crash when loading a model. This is fixed now.
- The MacOS build is now notarized by Apple, to prevent a security warning from popping up when starting Cura for the first time.
- Corrected the orientation of the build plate mesh for Tevo Tarantula Pro.

[4.7.0]
* Rotation widgets
fieldOfView has contributed code that adds 3 pairs of arrow widgets to the Rotate tool handle, to rotate objects by exactly 90 degrees.

* Performance improvements with multiple 3D models
In previous versions many objects on a build plate could cause Cura's performance and response to be slow. We have made some code optimizations to increase the responsiveness of Cura in such cases.

* Cloud connections improvements
Improved the overall UX workflow when a user is using a cloud connection. Check our new enhancements below.

* Moved tree-support from experimental to normal settings
We've made stability fixes and tested thoroughly so that it can be considered stable.

* Improve object list GUI
The object list indicates now the extruder used for each model, the mesh type if the model is not a normal mesh, and the number of per model setting overrides and whether a model is outside of the build plate. Contributed by fieldOfView.

* Support for MacOS Big Sur
Ultimaker Cura will now run on Apple's upcoming operating system.

* Change normal support vs. tree support into a drop-down
There is now the option of easily switching between normal and tree support. You cannot enable both at the same time any more.

* Add "Multiply model" to Edit menu
The option is now also accessible in the Edit menu and not only in the context menu (right-click).

* Add local printer improvements
Whenever the user wants to add a non-networked printer it is now easier to distinguish the scrollbar and some more information regarding the selected printer in our new redesigned layout. Have a look yourself! Brought to us by fieldOfView.

* Show all while searching per object settings
For more ease-of-use, the behavior has been changed so that all settings are visible temporarily, even if initial were hidden.

* Search through setting descriptions
When searching through the custom settings, the results include all the matches found in both the setting names and setting descriptions. This makes some settings easier to find if you don't remember the name.

* Check for account updates manually
A check for update/sync/refresh button was added near the account so that the user can manually check for updates of subscribed Marketplace packages and available Digital Factory printers.

* Always select last write-device
Cura will now remember the last used output device to save the g-code to (to file, USB stick, etc.) Contributed by fieldOfView.

* Improved sync with the Ultimaker Marketplace
Profile picture and links to the Digital Factory have been improved in the account dropdown.

* Add option to sign in with another account while looking for cloud printers
The "Sign in with a different account" link logs the user off both from Cura and the browser, so that they can sign in with another account. In case the other account has extra cloud printers, then these printers are added to Cura and are available for use.

* Show warning in printer management page that removing is temporary
When removing a printer in your Digital Factory, a message pops up to inform the user that the printer will be re-added in the next sync.

* Show cloud connection not available
We now display an offline icon when losing connection to a printer in the Digital Factory.

* Show notification when printer is removed from account
We show a notification when a printer is removed from the account. You can either go to the account page to restore access or remove it from Cura. In order to establish a new connection, the user is directed to the Digital Factory.

* Add an offline printer, linked to an account, to Cura
Printers that are temporarily offline (but previously added to your account) will also be added to Cura. You won't be able to send a print to that printer, but you could slice for it and store the g-code elsewhere.

* Adjust initial layer horizontal expansion
We adjusted the initial layer horizontal expansion for some profiles. This compensates for Elephant's Foot, a small defect where the bottom of the print has a little ridge where it is molten to the build plate.

* Allow a g-code to be inserted before or after pausing
It allows the user to enter a custom g-code before and after a pause at height. Contributed by rodrigosclosa.

* Remove package ratings
The package ratings have been removed from the Marketplace.

* Remove extra skin wall count in concentric
Hide "Extra Skin Wall Count" setting if a concentric pattern is used, and don't let it affect the print any more.

* Support Stair Step Minimum Slope Angle
With this setting you can disable stair stepping on the very bottom of the support, up until the slope of the model has a certain angle.

* Pause at Height scripts combined
Instead of having various scripts to use for different machines, there is now just one Pause at Height post-processing script, so all printers can now have the same features when pausing. Contributed by fieldOfView.

* Pause at Height limited to 1 redo layer
The "redo layers" setting is replaced by a checkbox to redo just the last layer, to prevent colliding the print head with previously printed layers.

* Change at Z improvements
Added support for changing Retract Length and Speed and fixed an issue when multiple changes are stacked on top of each other. Contributed by novamxd.

* Add post-processing script display progress on LCD
The "Display Progress On LCD" post-processing script shows the time left and the percentage on their LCD screen. Contributed by Bostwickenator.

* Add preference for single instance
If enabled, only one instance of Cura will be started at a time. Contributed by fieldOfView.

* Remove spaghetti infill
This setting was rarely used and didn't work well.

* Bug fixes
- Fixed issues with support no longer generated on some parts of the model. Support Stair Steps has caused some support to be missing where it touches the build plate or where it's resting on a shallow surface. It should be complete again.
- Fixed multiple different issues with tree support, where branches would intersect with the model, the wouldn't keep distance when resting on the model, or when printing with Spiralize mode.
- Fixed an issue where Cubic Subdivision infill didn't move along with the model.
- Cubic Subdivision will now rotate according to the Infill Line Directions setting. Contributed by smartavionics.
- X-ray view is now red again, instead of translucent green.
- Improved wording of the "Discard/Keep Changes" dialog for clarity.
- Models assigned to extruders >4 are visible again in layer view.
- Fixed an issue when importing images if the "Base" setting was greater than "Height".
- Cura now outputs a command to cool down the build plate for the second object in one-at-a-time mode even if the Initial Layer Build Plate Temperature is 0.
- Distance between infill and walls and between infill and skin is corrected when using Infill Layer Thickness.
- Fixed a crash when Coasting Minimum Volume is set to 0.
- The usable build volume will no longer be shrunk unnecessarily when not using any adhesion, but using a prime tower with a brim.
- Fixed a slicing crash when combining Randomize Infill Start with an even number for Infill Line Multiplier.
- Improved reduction of model resolution. The Maximum Resolution and Deviation settings should now be more accurate and no longer behave differently in one corner of the model.
- Removed an unintended gap when something was resting on an ironed surface.
- Fix skirt printing out of order, causing unnecessary travel moves. Contributed by smartavionics.
- A fix was added by smartavionics which removes unnecessary long moves that travel towards the outer wall.
- It wasn't possible to connect to a network printer if two network plugins were enabled simultaneously. Now made possible by Loociano.
- Support settings are now visible when you have support disabled, but a support mesh is present in the scene. Fixed by fieldOfView.
- Fix printing speed after performing a retraction when using the stretch post-processing script. Contributed by sgtnoodle.
- Prevent tool panels from overlapping with scene information. Fix made by smartavionics.
- The values of the machine settings would look cut-off on some Linux distributions. Now fixed by smartavionics.
- Fixed settings sometimes not appearing if they belong to a checkbox setting that is enabled by default (e.g. retraction settings belonging to Enable Retraction).
- We cleaned up our “About...” dialog. It is now up to date.
- Improve performance of loading profile metadata. This fix improves the start-up time of Cura.
- When loading images, the translucency and linear options were swapped. Translucency should now again be tuned for lithophanes, and linear for a height map. Contributed by michalsc.
- Retractions in travel move to next layer were sometimes omitted, but that's fixed now. Contributed by smartavionics.
- Fix initial layer thickness when empty initial layers are removed. Contributed by smartavionics.
- If Brim Replaces Support is enabled, the brim will now also replace support interface.

* Bug fixes
- We fixed a frustrating bug where a package would keep issuing a badge notification to update, even after the package had been updated.
- The Ultimaker 2+ generated an unwanted travel move that could drag priming material into the start of a print. This is now fixed.

[4.6.1]
* Bug fixes
- Changes to the Simplify() algorithm in 4.6.0 caused Z seam placement issues, which resulted in less-than-perfect results. This has been fixed.

[4.6.0]

THANK YOU to all Ultimaker Cura users helping in the fight against COVID-19 – with 3D printing, volunteering, or just by staying home. Want to get involved? Find out more at https://ultimaker.com/in/cura/covid-19

* New Intent profiles.
In version 4.4 we introduced Intent profiles for the Ultimaker S3 and Ultimaker S5 which allow you to start prints at the click of a button without a lot of configuration steps. Due to popular demand, version 4.6 expands the range of Engineering Intent profiles to include more of the Ultimaker material portfolio: PC, Nylon, CPE, and CPE+. These work with 0.4 print cores.

* Show active post processing scripts.
fieldOfview has contributed an ease of use improvement to the post processing plugin. The number of enabled post processing scripts will now display as a badge notification over the post processing scripts icon. A tooltip gives extra information about which scripts are enabled for quick and easy inspection, so there's no need to open the post processing dialog.

* Hole Horizontal Expansion.
smartavionics has contributed a new setting that applies an offset to all holes on each layer, allowing you to manually enlarge or contract holes to compensate for horizontal expansion.

* Per-model settings.
The "Infill only" checkbox has been changed to a dropdown selection: “Infill mesh only” or “Cutting mesh”.

* Transparent support rendering.
In preview mode with ‘Line type’ selected, support material will render with transparency so you can easily see what’s being supported.

* No stair stepping for PVA profiles.
Stair stepping is intended to reduce the adhesion between support and the model, where the support rests on the model, and to reduce scarring. As PVA doesn't suffer from scarring or adhesion issues due to its water-solubility, this value has been set to 0 for PVA profiles. A known issue with the stair stepping algorithm causes support to disappear sometimes, so doing this reduces the chance of that happening when PVA is used.

* Separators in extensions menu.
fieldOfview has contributed a method for plugin authors to add separators between menu items in the “Extensions” submenu. The method is backwards-compatible so changes don’t have to be made in Cura and Uranium together.

* Ultimaker account sign in prompt.
Added clearer text to the sign in popup and first use flow to highlight the benefits of using an Ultimaker account with Cura.

* Updated installer.
Small fixes have been made to the installer. To keep up with the times, we’ve also updated the images to display an Ultimaker S3 instead of an Ultimaker 3.

* Infill mesh ordering.
When you have three objects overlapping each other and you set two of them to "Modify settings for infill of other models", then the setting "Infill Mesh Order" determines which of the two infill meshes gets priority where they overlap. This was broken for cutting meshes, so BagelOrb contributed a fix.

* Backups storage size.
We’ve put a hard limit on backup file size in this release to prevent other files being stored there.

* 3MF gcode comments removed.
Fixed a bug where comments were removed from Start/End G-codes when opening from a 3MF.

* Print monitor preheat fields.
Values in the print monitor preheat fields were broken in previous versions, they have now been fixed by fieldOfview.

* Stepper motor disarming during pause at height.
Some printers automatically disable their steppers after a pause after a certain time. This script makes it possible to set that in the pause script (instead of relying on default behavior of the firmware).

* Crash if logging in on two instances at the same time.
During the beta period we caught a critical bug where logging in to an Ultimaker account with two instances of Cura would crash the second instance. It crashes because while the web page is open, Cura opens a web server in the local host. The web page redirects to that web server when you've logged in, so that it knows that the log-in was successful and what the credentials are. Both instances try to create a web server on the same port, which is impossible.

* "Changes detected from your Ultimaker account" message.
We fixed a bug on MacOS where duplicate "Changes detected from your Ultimaker account" popups would appear at a single time.

* Crashes when inactive.
Some people reported experiencing crashes when the computer had been inactive for a long time, or when the laptop got suspended or went to sleep. This has been fixed.

* Support blocker is not blocking support.
Fixed an issue where the support blocker was not blocking support.

* Sending slice message takes too long when using mesh helpers.
Fixed an issue where it would take too long to trigger a slice when using the mesh helpers and support blocker.

* Flying Bear printers.
oducceu has contributed a machine definition for the Flying Bear Ghost 4S Printer.

* Magicfirm printers.
jeffkyjin has contributed machine definitions for MBot Grid II+, MBot Grid II+ (dual), MBot Grid IV+ and MBot Grid IV+ (dual).

* HMS434.
Updates to the HMS434 machine definition have been contributed by maukcc.

* FabX Pro.
hussainsail2002 has contributed machine definitions for FabX Pro and print profiles for REDD materials.

* Disclaimer: Third-party machine definitions are accepted as contributed, and are not tested or maintained in any way by the Cura development team.
